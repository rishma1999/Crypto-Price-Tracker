# State Management Explanation

In this project, we used **React Query** for state management for the following reasons:

- **Data Fetching**: React Query simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data from APIs.

- **Automatic Caching**: It automatically caches the fetched data, which reduces the number of API calls and improves performance.

- **Data Synchronization**: React Query keeps the UI in sync with the server state, which is crucial for live data applications like a cryptocurrency price tracker.

- **Built-in Error Handling**: It provides built-in error handling mechanisms, making it easier to manage API errors.
